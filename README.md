# HTTP server in C

A minimal HTTP server, written in C, derived from ipconfig-http-server by [Jan Ahrens](https://github.com/JanAhrens/ipconfig-http-server) and c-http-server by [Ryan Mills](https://github.com/ryandaryl/c-http-server).

The C script can be compiled using the Heroku C [buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-c).
